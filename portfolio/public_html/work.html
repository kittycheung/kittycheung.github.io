Due to the pandemic, my team wanted to move away from distributing physical print-outs. We decided to offer the</span><a class="text-link" href="https://issuu.com/vancouverfringefest/docs/fringeprogramguide2020-full">Program Guide</a><span>as a digital PDF instead, where patrons had the option of printing from home. </span></p><h3>Accessibility Decisions</h3><p class="paragraph-cap">I was responsible for designing this 29-page guide, adapting the layout to be both screen- and printer-friendly. Considering the Fringe’s brand mission to promote “Theatre for Everyone!”, we wanted to ensure these guides would be accessible for people with various levels of digital literacy. To make the text easier to read from a screen, I increased the font sizes and column widths. Users therefore wouldn’t have to zoom in or drag to move around the page as much. For those who preferred to print out their guides, these changes also ensured the text would be legible on common letter-size paper. </p></div><figure><img src="img/fringe-page-2019-320x442.png" srcset="img/fringe-page-2019-320x442.png 320w, img/fringe-page-2019-673x930.png 673w" sizes="(min-width: 20rem) 90vw, (min-width: 35rem) 40vw" alt="a page from the 2019 program guide with smaller text and narrower columns"><img src="img/fringe-page-2020-320x448.jpeg" srcset="img/fringe-page-2020-320x448.jpeg 320w, img/fringe-page-2020-700x1008.jpeg 700w" sizes="(min-width: 20rem) 90vw, (min-width: 43rem) 40vw" alt="a page from the 2020 program guide with larger text and wider columns"><figcaption>Comparing pages from the 2019 and 2020 guides, notice how the page with larger text and wider columns is easier to read from this screen. 2019 page designed by Courtney McLachlin. </figcaption></figure><div class="padded-work"><p class="paragraph-cap">For patrons wanting to print in greyscale, whether to save money or ink, I used the program “Color Oracle” to test for greyscale. My team chose to offer this printing option for patrons who wanted a more tactile experience, especially since previous year’s festivals offered booklets where they could flip through and make notes to plan their shows. I also used Color Oracle to test for different types of colour blindness, ensuring that everyone would be able to read the pages regardless of their cones and rods. By designing a screen- and printer-friendly version of the Program Guide, I supported the Festival’s COVID safety measures. </p></div><figure><img src="img/schedule-pg-320x448.jpeg" srcset="img/schedule-pg-320x448.jpeg 320w, img/schedule-pg-720x1008.jpeg 720w" sizes="(min-width: 20rem) 90vw, (min-width: 35rem) 40vw" alt="a schedule page in colour"><img src="img/schedule-pg-greyscale-320x448.jpeg" srcset="img/schedule-pg-greyscale-320x448.jpeg 320w, img/schedule-pg-greyscale-720x1008.jpeg 720w" sizes="(min-width: 20rem) 90vw, (min-width: 35rem) 40vw" alt="a schedule page in greyscale"><figcaption>The colours on this page were chosen such that they have high enough contrast for the text to be legible in greyscale too. </figcaption></figure><div class="padded-work"><h3>Reflection</h3><p class="paragraph-cap bottom-space">This project was a reminder that accessibility is key. Graphic design is about communicating a message, but if people are unable to access this information, whether due to small type or faint colours, the project fails to communicate. I therefore prioritize accessibility whenever I approach a new project. Despite pandemic restrictions, these changes to the Program Guide helped make theatre more accessible to the Fringe community. </p></div><footer><p>Designed and coded by Kitty Cheung. </p><a href="citations.html">Citations</a></footer></body></html>
